# AWS VPC ‚Äì Private EC2, Bastion, NAT Gateway, Elastic IP, and ENI Explained

This document explains step by step why a private EC2 cannot reach the internet directly, how Bastion and NAT Gateway solve different problems, and what role ENI and Elastic IP play. Written in a beginner-friendly way.

---

## 1. Problem Statement
- You have:
    - **Bastion EC2** ‚Üí deployed in **public subnets (1a, 1b)**.
    - **Private EC2** ‚Üí deployed in **private subnets (1a, 1b)**.
- From Bastion, you can SSH into the Private EC2 (‚úÖ works).
- But **pinging google.com from Private EC2 times out** (‚ùå internet not reachable).

---

## 2. Why This Happens
- Private EC2s do not have **direct internet access**.
- To give them outbound-only internet, you need a **NAT Gateway**.
- NAT Gateway must be in a **public subnet** (not private).

---

## 3. Fix ‚Äì Adding NAT Gateway
1. **Create NAT Gateway**
    - Place in **public subnet (e.g., 1a)**.
    - Attach an **Elastic IP**.
    - For high availability, create one NAT Gateway per AZ.

2. **Update Private Subnet Route Tables**
    - Private subnet 1a ‚Üí route `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway in 1a`.
    - Private subnet 1b ‚Üí route `0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway in 1b`.

3. **Check Security**
    - Private EC2 SG ‚Üí allow outbound traffic (default allows all).
    - Bastion EC2 SG ‚Üí allow inbound SSH.

---

## 4. Why NAT Gateway Must Be in a Public Subnet
- **Public subnet** = a subnet whose route table has a **route to the IGW (Internet Gateway)**.
- NAT Gateway needs IGW access to send traffic out to the internet.
- If you place NAT in a private subnet, it has no IGW route ‚Üí internet access fails.

---

## 5. Why Elastic IP is Required for NAT Gateway
- Internet Gateway only understands **public IPs**.
- Private EC2s only have **private IPs (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x, 192.168.x.x)**.
- NAT Gateway provides a **public identity** (Elastic IP) so responses from the internet know where to go back.
- Flow:
    1. Private EC2 (10.0.2.15) ‚Üí NAT Gateway.
    2. NAT rewrites source IP ‚Üí Elastic IP (e.g., 52.x.x.x).
    3. IGW sends to internet.
    4. Response ‚Üí Elastic IP ‚Üí NAT ‚Üí Private EC2.

## 6. Bastion Public IP vs NAT Elastic IP
| Feature                | Bastion Public IP                | NAT Gateway Elastic IP          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Who uses it**        | Admins (SSH/RDP)                 | Private EC2s (automatic use)    |
| **Direction**          | Inbound (Internet ‚Üí VPC)         | Outbound (VPC ‚Üí Internet)       |
| **Subnet type**        | Public subnet                    | Public subnet                   |
| **Used for**           | SSH into VPC                     | Software updates, external APIs |
| **Identity visible**   | Bastion EC2 itself               | All private EC2s share this EIP |

üëâ Analogy:
- Bastion = **office door** (lets you in).
- NAT = **office phone line** (lets you call out, but hides desk phones).

## 7. Does NAT Gateway Have Both Private IP and Elastic IP?
‚úÖ Yes.
- **Private IP** ‚Üí assigned from the subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.50).
- **Elastic IP** ‚Üí public identity for internet.

### Flow:
1. Private EC2 ‚Üí NAT‚Äôs **private IP**.
2. NAT ‚Üí translates to its **Elastic IP**.
3. Internet ‚Üí replies to Elastic IP.
4. NAT ‚Üí translates back to EC2 private IP.

So NAT has **both legs**:
- One in the **private world (private IP)**.
- One in the **public world (Elastic IP)**.

---

## 8. Why NAT‚Äôs Private IP Isn‚Äôt Public, Even in a Public Subnet
- Subnet type doesn‚Äôt decide whether an IP is public or private.
- Subnet IPs are always **private (10.x, 172.16.x, 192.168.x)**.
- A **public IP (Elastic IP)** is a separate AWS-managed resource mapped to the ENI.
- So NAT Gateway in a public subnet still gets a **private IP** from subnet CIDR + an Elastic IP for internet.

---

## 9. What is ENI (Elastic Network Interface)?
- **ENI = AWS‚Äôs virtual network card**.
- Just like your laptop‚Äôs Wi-Fi card gives it an IP, ENI gives AWS resources (EC2, NAT, Load Balancer) their IPs.

### ENI properties:
- Has a **private IP** (from subnet).
- Can have a **public/Elastic IP** mapped.
- Linked to **security groups** and **routing**.

### NAT Gateway ENI example:
- Private IP = 10.0.1.50 (internal use).
- Elastic IP = 54.12.34.56 (public identity).
- Private EC2 talks to 10.0.1.50, internet sees 54.12.34.56.

---

## 10. Analogy Recap
- **Network Card (NIC)** in a laptop = gives it IP and lets it connect to router/internet.
- **ENI in AWS** = virtual NIC that gives EC2/NAT/etc. an IP inside a subnet.
- **Elastic IP** = like your SIM card‚Äôs phone number that outsiders can dial.
- **Bastion** = office door (inbound access).
- **NAT Gateway** = office phone line (outbound access).
