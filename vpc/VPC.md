# 1 — Overview & analogy (the teacher’s story)

Abishek explained VPCs using a real-life gated-community analogy:

* AWS = the builder who purchased a huge land (data centers in regions).
* VPC = a gated community (your private chunk of network inside AWS).
* Subnets = neighborhoods inside the community (you split the VPC IP range into smaller ranges).
* Internet Gateway (IGW) = the main gate to the community (for public access).
* Security guards at gates = Network ACLs (applied at subnet-level).
* Security guards at houses = Security Groups (applied at instance-level).
* Bastion = a guarded public house used as a jump point to reach private houses.
* NAT Gateway = the community post office that hides private house addresses when they talk to the outside world.
* Load Balancer = a concierge who receives public requests and forwards them to private houses.

This story maps directly to AWS components and is useful to remember how traffic flows and where you add security.

---

# 2 — IP addresses (IPv4) — what they look like & how the computer sees them

**IPv4** address = 32 bits = 4 * 8-bit octets. Example formats you’ll see:

* `172.16.3.4`
* `10.0.1.2`
* `192.168.0.14`

Each octet is one byte (8 bits). Each octet can range `0..255` because 8 bits can represent values `0..255` (2⁸−1).

**How to convert an octet to binary** (example `192`):

* Binary weights (right→left): 2⁰=1, 2¹=2, 2²=4, 2³=8, 2⁴=16, 2⁵=32, 2⁶=64, 2⁷=128
* 192 = 128 + 64 => binary `11000000`

**Exercise example (from video):** convert `172.16.3.4` to binary octets:

* 172 → binary `10101100`
* 16  → binary `00010000`
* 3   → binary `00000011`
* 4   → binary `00000100`

(Write them down as 4 groups of 8 bits if you practice; this helps when reading subnets.)

---

# 3 — CIDR (how `/X` works) — exact math + examples

CIDR notation: `a.b.c.d/X`

* `X` = number of bits fixed for the **network** (the rest are host bits).
* Number of addresses in that block = `2^(32 - X)`.

**Worked examples (digit-by-digit):**

* `/24`

  * 32 − 24 = 8
  * 2⁸ = 256 → **256 total addresses** in a `/24` block.

* `/27`

  * 32 − 27 = 5
  * 2⁵ = 32 → **32 addresses**

* `/30`

  * 32 − 30 = 2
  * 2² = 4 → **4 addresses**

* `/31` (when you need just 2 addresses)

  * 32 − 31 = 1
  * 2¹ = 2 → **2 addresses**

* `/8`

  * 32 − 8 = 24
  * 2²⁴ = 16,777,216 → **16,777,216 addresses** (massive — Class A range)

**Important practical note (from the video & AWS):**

* In general networking math use `2^(32-X)`. In AWS subnets you should remember AWS reserves 5 IPs in each subnet for networking (first 4 and the broadcast/reserved address). So usable addresses = `2^(32-X) - 5` (for AWS-managed purposes). This is useful when sizing.

**Practical CIDR exercises Abishek suggested:**

* What is number of IPs for `172.168.3.0/30` → 32−30=2 → 2²=4 addresses.
* What is number of IPs for `10.0.0.0/8` → 32−8=24 → 2²⁴=16,777,216 addresses.

---

# 4 — Subnets — why, and private vs public

**Why use subnets?**

* Isolation, security and limiting blast radius. If one machine in subnet is compromised, well-configured subnets + security can limit lateral movement.

**Types:**

* **Public subnet**: Has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW). Instances here can have public IPs (or be used by public-facing services like load balancers).
* **Private subnet**: No direct route to IGW. Instances here typically have no public IPs. They access the internet via a NAT Gateway (for updates etc.) or don't access internet at all.

**How to carve subnets from a VPC CIDR**

* Example: VPC `172.16.0.0/16` → 65,536 addresses.

  * Create `172.16.3.0/24` for finance (256 addresses).
  * Create `172.16.4.0/24` for another team, etc.

**Special note from the video about private address ranges:**

* Common private ranges (RFC 1918): `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`. You’ll often see these used for private subnets. Avoid using public blocks that might collide with internet addresses (e.g. `8.8.8.8`).

---

# 5 — Ports: what they are (quick)

* Ports let you host multiple services on the same IP. They range `0..65535`.
* Examples:

  * `22` SSH
  * `80` HTTP
  * `443` HTTPS
  * `8080` / `8000` – often used for apps during development
  * `3306` MySQL — avoid reusing service ports unless you mean to.

---

# 6 — Two prerequisites before OSI model: DNS resolution & TCP handshake

**DNS resolution**

* Browser / router resolves `www.google.com` → IP (via local cache → ISP DNS → authoritative DNS).
* If DNS isn’t resolved, the data journey should not start.

**TCP 3-way handshake** (SYN / SYN-ACK / ACK)

1. Client sends `SYN` (synchronization / “Hi, I want to talk”).
2. Server replies `SYN-ACK` (synchronization + acknowledgement / “Hi, I heard you”).
3. Client sends `ACK` (acknowledgement / “OK — start sending data”).

* This establishes a TCP connection prior to data transfer.

---

# 7 — OSI Model (mapped to browser → Google example)

Layer-by-layer (when you request `https://www.google.com`):

* **Layer 7 — Application (HTTP/HTTPS)**: Browser forms an HTTP request (headers, cookies).
* **Layer 6 — Presentation**: Encryption / encoding (HTTPS, SSL/TLS negotiation).
* **Layer 5 — Session**: Session creation / cookies (session persistence).

  * Note: Layers 5–7 are typically handled by the browser in our web example.
* **Layer 4 — Transport (TCP/UDP)**: Data segmentation; protocol decision (TCP for HTTP).
* **Layer 3 — Network**: Packets with source/destination IP -> routers choose best path (routing).
* **Layer 2 — Data Link**: Frames on LAN, MAC addresses used by switches.
* **Layer 1 — Physical**: Electrical/optical signals on cables.

**When data is sent** it goes L7 → L1 (client stacks it). At the receiving server it goes L1 → L7 (server unpacks). OSI is conceptually useful even if TCP/IP model compresses layers.

---

# 8 — VPC components (how they interact — the full map from the transcript)

Essential components and where they sit in the analogy:

* **VPC** — your private network; defined by a CIDR (example: `10.0.0.0/16`).
* **Subnets** — split the VPC into address ranges (public / private).
* **Internet Gateway (IGW)** — public access; attach to VPC to enable public subnets to reach internet.
* **Route Tables** — control where traffic in subnets goes (0.0.0.0/0 → IGW for public subnets).
* **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB / NLB)** — placed in public subnet; accepts internet traffic and forwards into private subnets (target groups).
* **Target Groups** — the set of instances / ports the ALB forwards to.
* **Security Groups (SGs)** — instance-level, stateful allow rules. The **last line of defense** just before the instance.
* **Network ACLs (NACL / NACLs)** — subnet-level, stateless, ordered rules. The **first line of defense** at subnet boundary.
* **NAT Gateway** — used by private instances to access internet for downloads while hiding their private IPs.
* **Elastic IP (EIP)** — static public IP (used by NAT Gateway to present a single public IP).
* **Bastion (jump host)** — public instance used to ssh into private instances for admin tasks.
* **Autoscaling group** — creates instances from a launch template; can run across AZs; scales by load.
* **Health checks** — target groups use them; ALB forwards only to healthy instances.

---

# 9 — Security deep dive: Security Groups vs Network ACLs (NACLs)

This part follows the video’s demo exactly.

### Security Group (SG)

* Scope: **Instance level**
* State: **Stateful** — return traffic is automatically allowed.
* Rules: **Allow only** (no deny); no ordered priority.
* Default: When you create an SG AWS allows **all outbound** traffic by default but blocks inbound (you add inbound rules as needed).
* Example SG inbound rule to allow your app:

  * Protocol: TCP
  * Port: `8000`
  * Source: `0.0.0.0/0` (for demo only — production should be locked down)

### Network ACL (NACL)

* Scope: **Subnet level**
* State: **Stateless** — you must explicitly allow inbound & outbound.
* Rules: Can **Allow** and **Deny**. Rules are matched **in ascending order** by rule number; first matching rule applies.
* AWS default NACL initially **allows all** inbound/outbound (in the demo Abishek showed default allowed all until changed).
* Example rules order and effect:

  * Rule 100: `ALLOW all` → traffic is permitted (first match).
  * Rule 200: `DENY custom TCP port 8000` → would only be evaluated if rule 100 did not match.
  * If you change order so that `DENY 8000` is rule 100 and `ALLOW all` becomes 200, NACL will block port 8000 despite SG allowing it.

**Key principle (from video)**:
`NACL` can block traffic for the entire subnet (50/50 automation for many instances), while `SG` is instance-level control. Even if SG allows traffic, the NACL can deny and prevent it reaching instances.

---

# 10 — End-to-end practical lab (step-by-step)

Below I reproduce the hands-on demo steps Abishek followed. Use AWS Console (or adapt to CLI if you prefer).

> **Lab goal:** Create a VPC, public + private subnets (multi-AZ), Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Autoscaling group of EC2 instances in private subnets, Bastion host, ALB in public subnets, Target Group, configure SG & NACL and demonstrate allow/deny behavior. Run a simple Python HTTP server on an instance (port 8000) like the video.

### 0. Prerequisites

* AWS account and console access.
* SSH key pair (pem file). Keep your private key locally (`AWS_login.pem` in examples).
* Basic terminal with `ssh` and `scp`.

---

### A — Create the VPC (use “VPC and more” to auto-create basic resources)

1. AWS Console → Services → **VPC**.
2. Click **Create VPC** → choose **VPC and more** (it will create public & private subnets, route tables, IGW, etc.).
3. Name: `demo-vpc` (or `aws-prod-example` used in video).
4. IPv4 CIDR: choose `/16` (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`) — Abishek used `/16` to get 65,536 addresses.
5. Number of AZs: 2, number of public subnets: 2, number of private subnets: 2.
6. Leave IPv6 disabled (unless you need it).
7. Click **Create VPC**. AWS will create the subnets, IGW, route tables automatically.

**Note from video:** If you use “VPC only”, you must create subnets/IGW yourself. “VPC and more” is convenient for the demo.

---

### B — (Optional) Inspect the resource map

* VPC → Resource map (visual). You’ll see public/private subnets, IGW, route tables, and default NACLs/Security groups.

---

### C — Launch an AutoScaling group (via Launch Template)

(Abishek created a launch template, then an autoscaling group that uses private subnets — instances will have no public IP)

1. EC2 → Launch Templates → **Create Launch Template**

   * Name: `aws-prod-launch-template`
   * AMI: Ubuntu Server (or your preferred OS)
   * Instance type: `t2.micro` (free-tier for demo)
   * Key pair: `AWS_login.pem` (select your key)
   * Network: select the previously created VPC
   * Security Group (for instances): create one with inbound rules for SSH (22) **only from Bastion** (we will make Bastion do SSH), and app port (8000) if you want (video opened port 8000 for demo).

2. Create Launch Template.

3. EC2 → **Auto Scaling Groups** → Create AutoScaling Group

   * Use the launch template created.
   * Name: `aws-prod-asg`
   * Select VPC and **private subnets** (both AZs).
   * Desired capacity: `2` (min 2, max 3 in demo discussion).
   * Skip attaching load balancer now (we will create ALB separately).

4. Wait — the ASG will create 2 instances (one in each AZ).

**Important**: Instances in the private subnets will **not** have public IP addresses — that’s intentional for security.

---

### D — Bastion host (jump server) in Public Subnet

(You cannot SSH directly into private instances, so you use a Bastion.)

1. EC2 → Launch instance — pick Ubuntu, `t2.micro`, key `AWS_login.pem`.
2. Network: choose the **same VPC**, and place the Bastion in a **public subnet**.
3. Enable auto-assign public IPv4 (so you can reach it from your laptop).
4. Create a Security Group for Bastion: allow **SSH (22)** from your IP (`My IP`). Save.

---

### E — Copy the private key to the Bastion (so Bastion can ssh into private instances)

From your laptop (local shell), run (example):

```bash
# Replace user@host and file paths as appropriate
scp -i ~/keys/AWS_login.pem ~/keys/AWS_login.pem ubuntu@<BASTION-PUBLIC-IP>:/home/ubuntu/
```

**Why?** Bastion will use that same key to SSH into private EC2s.

---

### F — SSH into Bastion then to private instance

From your laptop:

```bash
ssh -i ~/keys/AWS_login.pem ubuntu@<BASTION-PUBLIC-IP>
# you are now on bastion
# list the private PEM file on the bastion
ls -l AWS_login.pem
# ssh into private instance
ssh -i AWS_login.pem ubuntu@10.0.14.109   # example private IP shown in video
```

**Note:** Use the private IP of the instance (from EC2 console).

---

### G — Install a simple Python HTTP server on one of the instances

(On the private instance via Bastion → private instance):

```bash
# update
sudo apt update -y
# (optional) install python3 if missing
# create a simple index.html
cat > index.html <<'HTML'
<html>
<head><title>My AWS Demo App</title></head>
<body><h1>My first AWS project — in private subnet</h1></body>
</html>
HTML

# run a simple HTTP server on port 8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
# (Process will block terminal; run in the background or use tmux/screen)
```

---

### H — Security Group: open inbound port 8000 (demo)

* EC2 → Security Groups → edit the instance SG (attached to instance) → **Inbound rules**: add TCP 8000 `0.0.0.0/0` (for demo only).
* Now try to access the ALB or instance (if instance had public IP). In the demo, E2 was private, so ALB/SG/NACL flow is used.

**Video behavior:** When SG allowed 8000 and NACL allowed traffic, you could load the page. If NACL denies 8000, the page fails despite SG allowing it.

---

### I — NACL demonstration (order matters)

NACL rules are **ordered**. The video demo used these manipulations:

1. Initially NACL inbound rules allowed all traffic → traffic went to instance (assuming SG allowed).
2. Add an inbound NACL rule to **deny TCP port 8000** with rule number `100`. Because rule 100 is evaluated first, it will block port 8000.
3. If instead `ALLOW all` is rule 100 and `DENY port 8000` is rule 200, ALLOW all will match first and port 8000 is permitted.
4. Reordering the rule numbers changes behavior (the first matching rule decides).

**Demo steps:**

* Go to VPC → Network ACLs → find NACL for the private subnet → **Edit inbound rules** → add a custom rule:

  * Rule #: `100`
  * Type: Custom TCP
  * Port range: `8000`
  * Source: `0.0.0.0/0`
  * Allow / Deny: `Deny`
* Try reaching the server — it fails even when SG allows it.

Then reorder numbers to demonstrate how allowing earlier permits traffic again.

---

### J — Create Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets

1. EC2 → Load Balancers → Create → **Application Load Balancer**.
2. Scheme: **internet-facing**
3. VPC: choose your `demo-vpc`.
4. Subnets: both **public subnets** (both AZs).
5. Security Group: ensure ALB SG allows **HTTP 80** from `0.0.0.0/0` (or desired source).
6. Create a **Target Group** (protocol HTTP, port 8000) and register the two private instances (you can choose their private IPs and the port 8000).
7. Attach target group to ALB’s listener.

**Important notes from the video:**

* If the ALB listener port (e.g. port 80) is not allowed in the ALB’s security group, the ALB will show "listener port not reachable" error. Fix by opening HTTP/80 inbound on the ALB SG.
* Target group health check will send probes to port 8000. ALB will forward requests only to healthy targets. In the demo Abishek deployed the HTML in only one instance — so ALB forwarded only to the healthy one.

---

### K — NAT Gateway + EIP (for private instances to access internet)

* NAT Gateway must be in a **public subnet** and have an **Elastic IP (EIP)**.
* Private subnets’ route table should have `0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway` to allow outbound internet while keeping instances private.
* Abishek showed the reason: **masking private instance IPs** when they talk to internet (downloads, package installs), so external services don't see the private IP.

---

# 11 — Demo commands (copied from the transcript)

**Copy PEM to Bastion:**

```bash
scp -i ~/keys/AWS_login.pem ~/keys/AWS_login.pem ubuntu@<BASTION-PUBLIC-IP>:/home/ubuntu/
```

**SSH into Bastion:**

```bash
ssh -i ~/keys/AWS_login.pem ubuntu@<BASTION-PUBLIC-IP>
```

**From Bastion → SSH into private instance:**

```bash
ssh -i AWS_login.pem ubuntu@10.0.14.109   # replace with instance private IP
```

**Run Python HTTP server on port 8000:**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**If needed run server on port 80 (requires sudo or root):**

```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

---

# 12 — Troubleshooting & tips (from video)

* **ALB not reachable** → check ALB Security Group inbound listener port. If ALB listens on 80, SG must allow 80 inbound.
* **Instance not reachable** → check:

  * NACL rules (subnet): can deny traffic before SG.
  * SG inbound rules at instance level.
  * Route tables (public subnet must route 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW).
* **NACL ordering matters** — lower rule number evaluated first. If a DENY for port 8000 is at low number, it blocks traffic even if higher-number rule allows all.
* **AWS blocks outbound 25 by default** — to reduce spam risk. If your app needs to send email via SMTP 25, you have to request a removal (but for most cases use SES or other port).
* **Elastic IP limit** — if you run into “max elastic IPs” errors, release unused EIPs in EC2 → Network & Security → Elastic IPs (as Abishek did).
* **ALB health checks** → ALB forwards only to healthy targets. If youDeploy the app to only one of the instances your ALB will route only to that healthy instance.

---

# 13 — Exercises & checklist (practice like Abishek)

Practice these steps in a sandbox AWS account:

1. Create a VPC `/16` via **VPC and more**.
2. Launch autoscaling group in private subnets (2 instances).
3. Launch a Bastion in public subnet and copy PEM via `scp`.
4. SSH via Bastion → private instance, run `python3 -m http.server 8000` and deliver index.html.
5. Create ALB in public subnets, target group → port 8000.
6. Allow ALB inbound 80 on ALB SG; allow instance SG inbound 8000.
7. Experiment:

   * Add NACL rule DENY port 8000 (rule 100) → page fails.
   * Swap order so ALLOW all is rule 100, DENY port 8000 is 200 → page works.
8. Create NAT Gateway + EIP and point private route table to NAT (private instances should be able to `apt update` etc).
9. Deploy app in both instances and observe load balancing/health checks.

---

# 14 — Appendix — CIDR quick reference (worked examples)

* `/32` → 2^(0) = 1 IP (single host)
* `/31` → 2^(1) = 2 IPs
* `/30` → 2^(2) = 4 IPs
* `/29` → 2^(3) = 8 IPs
* `/28` → 2^(4) = 16 IPs
* `/27` → 2^(5) = 32 IPs
* `/26` → 2^(6) = 64 IPs
* `/25` → 2^(7) = 128 IPs
* `/24` → 2^(8) = 256 IPs

**Practice:** for `10.0.0.0/16` → 32−16=16 → 2¹⁶ = 65,536 addresses.

---

## Final notes & recommended next steps

* This README follows Abishek’s flow and examples exactly: IP basics → CIDR math → subnetting → OSI → DNS/TCP → VPC components → hands-on demo with SG/NACL examples and ALB/ASG/Bastion/NAT.
* If you want, I can now:

  * Convert this README to a **one-page printable PDF**,
  * Produce a **concise cheat-sheet** version (1 page),
  * Or create a step-by-step **scripted cloudformation / Terraform** implementation that reproduces the demo automatically (I can draft the HCL/CloudFormation here).

Which of those would you like next? No need to repeat anything — I have everything from your transcript and can proceed with whichever output you prefer.
